# DeepLearning.ai Courses Notes

You'll find on this repository my personal notes and summaries of the awesome Deep Learning Specialization of deeplearning.ai at Coursera.

This really cool course is composed of following 5 parts:
1. Neural Networks and Deep Learning.
2. Improving Deep Neural Networks: Hyperparameter tuning, Regularization and Optimization.
3. Structuring Machine Learning Projects.
4. Convolutional Neural Networks.
5. Sequence Models.
