# DeepLearning.ai Courses Notes

You'll find on this repository my personal notes and summaries of the awesome Deep Learning Specialization of deeplearning.ai at Coursera. I wrote them to force me understand every concept as much as possible.

This really cool Specialization is composed of following 5 courses:
1. [Neural Networks and Deep Learning](https://github.com/barralf/deeplearning-coursera/tree/master/1.%20Neural%20Networks%20and%20Deep%20Learning)
2. [Improving Deep Neural Networks: Hyperparameter tuning, Regularization and Optimization](https://github.com/barralf/deeplearning-coursera/tree/master/2.%20Improving%20Deep%20Neural%20Networks)
3. [Structuring Machine Learning Projects](https://github.com/barralf/deeplearning-coursera/tree/master/3.%20Structuring%20Machine%20Learning%20Projects)
4. [Convolutional Neural Networks](https://github.com/barralf/deeplearning-coursera/tree/master/4.%20Convolutional%20Neural%20Networks)
5. [Sequence Models](https://github.com/barralf/deeplearning-coursera/tree/master/5.%20Sequence%20Models)

Note these summaries are (still?😝) not exhaustive and there exists much better ones.
That's why, and especially for course 5, I advise you to read the [following notes](https://github.com/mbadry1/DeepLearning.ai-Summary/tree/master/5-%20Sequence%20Models), they are really cool.

Kudos and thank you so much Andrew Ng, Kian Katan & Younes Bensouda Mourri! 🙌😊👍
